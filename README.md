# Automated-Proxmox-Backup
This repository contains a bash script to automate the backup of VMs and LXC containers on Proxmox VE 7. The script performs weekly backups, uploads them to separate Google Drive accounts using Rclone, and manages old backups by automatically deleting them after a specified period.
